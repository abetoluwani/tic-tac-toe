### **Tic Tac Toe Game Development**

I developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game using Flutter, leveraging the GetX state management library for a seamless and responsive experience. Here's a detailed overview of the project:

- **Flutter & Dart:** Utilized Flutter and Dart to create a cross-platform mobile application with a smooth and intuitive user interface.
- **GetX State Management:** Implemented GetX for efficient state management, ensuring that the game's state updates reactively and efficiently.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Designed the game using a component-based approach, creating reusable and modular widgets to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **MVC Pattern:** Adopted the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate concerns and organize the codebase effectively:
  - **Model:** Defined the game state, rules, and logic.
  - **View:** Built interactive and visually appealing UI components using Flutter widgets.
  - **Controller:** Managed game state and user interactions, facilitating communication between the model and view.
